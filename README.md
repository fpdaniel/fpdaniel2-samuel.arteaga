>	The repository contains two header files, DocumentIndex.h and GetLine.h, and three cpp files, DocumentIndex.cpp,
>	GetLine.cpp, and main.cpp. There are also numerous text files which are read by the header and cpp files as well
> 	as written to. The main.cpp tests the output of the other header and cpp files. GetLine.h declares a couple of getline functions, 
> 	while it's cpp file complement implements the two different types of getline functions, called dependent on the parameters. 
>	DocumentIndex.h defines and implements two different classes and one struct, and their public and private members. One of the classes
> 	is used to open a single file and keep track of it's current page number, the other class creates an index for the given document
>	file and writes the index to the given file. Finally, the struct keeps track of how many times a word appears and stores
> 	sorted page number appearances for a given word.
