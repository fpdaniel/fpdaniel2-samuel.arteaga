# This .gitignore was based off of a template for C++ projects that I found on GitHub.
# It lists more extensions than are actually included in or generated by this project.
# I kept some of them in this file anyway since I don't think it will cause any problems,
# and since I am on Linux and have not done much research on other operating systems,
# I am not entirely sure what file extensions other operating systems produce from compilation.
